Lolsnake
========

Steps to build demo:
  - ./build.sh

Steps to run demo:
  - ./lolsnake_demo

Clone project:
  - git clone git@github.com:bor0/lolsnake.git

I am aware that the rendering sucks, but can you recommend something that is more powerful than system("cls") ?

This is a demo project, made for funs.

Feel free to make a pull request that will implement food handling :-)
